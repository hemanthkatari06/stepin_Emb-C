Introduction


Seat Monitoring System based on Temperature: Currently many people are looking for the Advanced Technologies.This system presents a Microcontroll(atmega328) based Seat measurement system to dectect and confirm the presence/absence of person on the seat. In this system the sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then the temperature need to be set accordingly. Based on the controller it will set the temperature and it is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats. And whatever the heat is generated that point it will be displaying on displays like (Liquid crystal display (LCD),Light emitting diode (LED) backlit LCD, Thin film Transistors (TFT) LCD).

Features

1.It sense whether the person is existed or not.
2.The person can request, the Heater accordinging to that the heat will generate.
3.This system is reliable.
4.The person can modify the temperature by observing the display which is given in the system.
5.It is compatable.
