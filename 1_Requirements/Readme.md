the vehicle will gives the indication. Af the indication is done it will check the heat. After the indication passenger can modify the temperature
by seeing the display.

#SWOT ANALYSIS - Strengths, weakness, opportunities, Threats


Strengths - Easy to change the temperature values, low cost, easy to understand, very efficient.

Weakness - Hard to keep it, you cant make any alternation.

Opportunities - It can be implemented by replacing heater by air conditioners and any other devices.

Threats - Not suitable for High temperature environment.
