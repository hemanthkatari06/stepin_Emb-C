##Automatic Seat Heat Monitoring and Controlling System


#INTRODUCTION

The main aim of this case study is the button sensor will check the passenger is seated or not. By using temperature sensor we can detect 
the passenger is seated or not and also the heater will check the heater button is ON or NOT. This is a very safety, comfort and convenient
system for present days. In present days as technology increased people also found so many convenient ways. Embedded systems are performed
major role in present technologies.

#FEATURES

It is capable to determining wheater person is sitting or not by using sensors and check the heater, after that if passenger was present in 
the vehicle will gives the indication. Af the indication is done it will check the heat. After the indication passenger can modify the temperature
by seeing the display.

#SWOT ANALYSIS - Strengths, weakness, opportunities, Threats


Strengths - Easy to change the temperature values, low cost, easy to understand, very efficient.

Weakness - Hard to keep it, you cant make any alternation.

Opportunities - It can be implemented by replacing heater by air conditioners and any other devices.

Threats - Not suitable for High temperature environment.
